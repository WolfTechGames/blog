Hello everyone, this week we have gotten player eating and rocks in the game. I was wanting to add everything I mentioned in the previous post but I had a hard time getting the player eating down but in the end it seems like I completely overlooked the whole situation and it was easier then I though it would be. I kept trying to do network calls to process the eating of the player and respawning but then figured that I could have done it locally and just check if the object is yours so that it only gets called once on every object on collision. Here is a sample of the player eating:

Current Progress:
- Eating Players (Done)
- Rocks (Done)
