title: Slymes and Gamemodes! Closed Alpha Too!
author: seby
---

Hello everyone, we are back with another blog post! I am glad to say we have made tons of progress over this week, it was more than I expected. We now have name tags over each slime in game which
fetches your name from steam, it also turns toward you the main player so you are able to see what it say's no matter which way the opponent or ally is facing. That is not the best part though, the best part
is that we now have full gamemode support! To make this happen we used an abstract class that contains all the base slime code and net code for the slime, then from there when we want to make a new gamemode
we create a new script derived from that abstract class and just add more functionality to it depending on the gamemode and then add it to the database and voila we have a new playable gamemode. So far the only gamemodes playable are,
Free for all and Team deathmatch.

Here is a picture of the menu:

We might also happen to have the best looking Loading screen in the industry. (Sarcasm)
