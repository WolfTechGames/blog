As 2016 comes to a close, itâ€™s time to discuss our plans for the future at WolfTech Games. 2016 was a great year hallmarked by our first steam-released game, Slymes. We will continue to improve the game with balance and content patches, such as the ongoing holiday event. However, we will also be working on brand new projects. Hexane development will become our main priority as we plan for a 2017 release. As well, we have some smaller projects that are still very early in the conceptual phase of development. All in all, 2017 will shape up to be a packed year for all of us at WolfTech Games. Happy New Years!
