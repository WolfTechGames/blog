Hello World! This is the very first blog post for our website, wolftechgames.com! Wolftech Games is a *very* small indie game studio that is ready to make amazing games! Our core group of developers include the programmer Seby and the artist Stew. This will be our dev blog, and the two of us will post updates and developments here as progress continues on our games. Our site is currently under construction, but we plan on launching it soon alongside the announcement of our first serious project. We can't wait!
