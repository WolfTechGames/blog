Sebastian(Seby) and Stew are sorry to say that after 7 years, WolfTech Games will be disbanding. The main reason is that we lost motivation for the project due to other commitments entering our life. We started this studio when we were young highschoolers with a hunger for game development. Ideas spewed from our minds and we wanted to push our skills to their limits. But as we grew older, we spent less and less time working on WolfTech projects as school and work became bigger aspects of our lives. After so many years with such little progress, we both agreed that it was best to officially end this project. We are both close friends and may continue to work on projects in the future, but the future is uncertain and for the time being all projects are put on hold indefinetely.
	All in-development games, such as Spacion, will now be considered cancelled.
	Our discord server will still be open, but no activity will be planned from Seby and Stew there.
	We apologize for the shortage of updates in the past few years, but we are still grateful for the wonderful community and memories made with WolfTech Games. We look forward to the next chapters in our lives.

- Stew Esho, Sebastian Maj
